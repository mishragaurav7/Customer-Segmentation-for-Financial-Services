# 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Customer Segmentation for Financial Services

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on identifying distinct customer segments based on financial behavior using KMeans clustering. By analyzing structured data such as age, income, credit score, loan amount, and investment value, the project aims to uncover patterns that can inform personalized financial services, targeted marketing, and strategic decision-making.

## 📂 Dataset Summary
- **Total Records:** 1,000 customers
- **Features:**
  - `Customer_Age`: Age of the customer
  - `Annual_Income`: Yearly income (in ₹)
  - `Credit_Score`: Creditworthiness rating
  - `Loan_Amount`: Amount of active loans
  - `Investment`: Value of investments made

----

## 🎯 Objective
Segment customers into meaningful groups based on financial indicators to better understand their behavior and preferences.

## ⚙️ Steps Performed

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- Cleaned and standardized the dataset using `StandardScaler` to ensure equal weighting across features.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualized distributions of age, income, credit score, loan, and investment using histograms.

- Used correlation heatmaps to understand feature relationships.

### 3. Optimal Cluster Selection
- Applied the **Elbow Method** to determine the best number of clusters.

- Found optimal `k = 4`.

### 4. KMeans Clustering
- Used `KMeans` algorithm to assign each customer to one of the four clusters based on feature similarity.

### 5. Cluster Interpretation
- Calculated average values within each cluster to interpret segment characteristics.
- Labeled each group based on financial behavior patterns.
